# ABSTRACT: tools for running Test::Routine tests

=head1 OVERVIEW

A Test::Routine::Runner takes a callback for building test instances, then uses
it to build instances and run the tests on it.  The Test::Routine::Runner
interface is still undergoing work, but the Test::Routine::Util exports for
running tests, descibed in L<Test::Routine|Test::Routine/Running Tests>, are
more stable.  Please use those instead, unless you are willing to deal with
interface breakage.
